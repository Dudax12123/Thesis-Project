# -------------- Gravity Turn --------------
TIME_TO_START_KICK = 7.5                        # time to start gravity turn; [s]
DURATION_INITIAL_KICK = 45.                     # duration of gravity turn; [s]

# -------------- Desired Orbit --------------
TARGET_ORBITAL_ALTITUDE = 500e3                             # altitude of desired orbit; [m]

# -------------- Earth Rotation (Optional) --------------
ENABLE_EARTH_ROTATION = True                # if True, include Earth rotation effects in azimuth/ECI calculations
LAUNCH_LATITUDE = 28.5                        # launch site latitude; [deg]

TRACK_HEADING_STATE = False                    # if True, propagate heading as an additional state when Earth rotation is enabled

# -------------- Azimuth / Inclination Mode --------------
# All three modes derive the initial launch azimuth from the spherical-geometry formula:
#   sin(beta) = cos(i_target) / cos(phi_launch)
# They differ in how they analyse the gap between that formula and the real achieved inclination.
#
#   "formula_compare":      Fly with the formula azimuth.
#                           Report the achieved inclination and its deviation from the target.
#
#   "formula_back_compare": Same as "formula_compare", but also back-derives an azimuth from
#                           the achieved inclination via the same formula and reports the
#                           difference between the formula azimuth and that back-derived azimuth.
#
#   "iterative":            Sweeps the launch azimuth over
#                           [beta_formula - RANGE, beta_formula + RANGE] in steps of
#                           AZIMUTH_ITER_STEP_DEG to find the azimuth that best achieves
#                           the target inclination.  The kick angle is fixed from the
#                           initial optimisation run (re-optimising per azimuth is too costly).
AZIMUTH_INCLINATION_MODE = "formula_compare"  # Options: "formula_compare", "formula_back_compare", "iterative"
AZIMUTH_ITER_STEP_DEG  = 0.1                  # [deg] azimuth step size for iterative sweep (only used when mode = "iterative")

AZIMUTH_ITER_TOL_DEG   = 0.05                 # [deg] inclination tolerance — warns and falls back if no solution found within this bound

# -------------- Guidance Mode Selection --------------
# Choose the guidance strategy for the trajectory:
#   "gravity_turn": Pure gravity turn all the way (traditional method)
#                   - Initial kick maneuver, then zero angle of attack throughout
#                   - No active guidance after kick
#   "simple_poly":  Simplified polynomial guidance (linear gamma transition)
#                   - Initial kick until atmosphere exit
#                   - Linear transition from current flight path angle to horizontal
#                   - Simple, stable, but not optimal
#   "linear_tangent": Linear tangent steering law (classical guidance)
#                   - Initial kick until atmosphere exit
#                   - tan(α + γ) varies linearly with time-to-go
#                   - Classic ascent guidance method
#   "bilinear_tangent": Bilinear tangent steering law (advanced guidance)
#                   - Initial kick until atmosphere exit
#                   - tan(α + γ) = ratio of two linear functions of time-to-go
#                   - More flexible than linear tangent, controls value and derivative
#   "apollo":       Apollo polynomial guidance (classical explicit guidance)
#                   - Initial kick until atmosphere exit
#                   - Polynomial acceleration profiles in x and y directions
#                   - Enforces position and velocity terminal constraints
#                   - Used in Apollo missions, more accurate than simple_poly
#   "cpr":          Constant Pitch Rate guidance
#                   - No kick maneuver — flies vertical, then CPR takes over immediately
#                   - Linearly ramps pitch angle θ from 90° (vertical) to 0° (horizontal)
#                   - θ_dot = (90° − 0°) / t_go; α = θ_cmd − γ at each step
#                   - t_go estimated with Apollo propellant-based formula at guidance start
#                   - No kick angle optimisation required
#   "peg":          Powered Explicit Guidance (PEG)
#                   - Same kick + gravity-turn Stage 1 as other modes
#                   - Activates in Stage 2 after atmosphere exit only
#                   - Solves for linear pitch program sin(pitch) = A + B*t each major cycle
#                   - Explicitly targets r_T, ṙ_T = 0, v_θ_T = √(μ/r_T) for circular orbit
#   "peg_new":      Analytical Predictor-Corrector PEG (from first principles)
#                   - Derived from Pontryagin's minimum principle (Jaggers 1977, McHenry et al. 1979)
#                   - Primary variable: v_go (2D velocity-to-be-gained vector)
#                   - t_go from rocket equation: t_go = τ·(1−exp(−‖v_go‖/c))
#                   - Position costate λ'_r from analytical formula (paper eq 71)
#                   - Steering: û = v_go/‖v_go‖ + λ'_r·(t−t_λ)·r̂  (normalised, eq 72)
#                   - Gravity handled naturally through v_go iteration (no ad-hoc C correction)
#                   - Stage 2 only, after atmosphere exit
#   "exp_shooting": Exponential pitch-law guidance with single-shot shooting optimization
#                   - Pitch angle: θ(t_rel) = a·exp(b·t_rel), α = θ − γ
#                   - (a, b) solved once at guidance start via scipy.optimize.fsolve
#                   - Terminal constraints: r(T_burnout) = r_T, γ(T_burnout) = 0
#                   - Fixed coefficients for the entire burn (open-loop after initialization)
#                   - Works with any GUIDANCE_START_MODE (after_kick or after_atmosphere_exit)
#   "indirect":     Indirect optimal control (PMP / TPBVP, minimum fuel)
#                   - Based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (eqs 59–64)
#                   - Hamiltonian H = λᵀf; optimality H_u=0 gives α*(t)=arctan2(λ_γ, v·λ_v)
#                   - Adjoint equations λ̇=−H_x integrated alongside state equations
#                   - Costates λ(t0) found by fsolve on 3D residual [r−r_T, v−v_circ, γ]
#                   - TPBVP solved once at guidance start; α*(t) interpolated thereafter
#                   - Terminal constraints: r=r_T, v=v_circ=√(μ/r_T), γ=0
#                   - Works with any GUIDANCE_START_MODE

#   "aerothermal_flux": Use aerothermal flux threshold (Phi = 0.5*rho*v^3)
